The Five Dreyfus Model Stages
=================================

1.Novices<br>
 >  have little or no previous experience in this skill area. By "experience" I mean specifically that performing this skill results in a change of thinking.
  As a conterexample, consider the case of the developer who claims ten years of experience, but in reality it was one year of experience repeated nine times.
  That doesn't count as `experience`.<br>
  `Novices need recipes`.<br>
  
2.Advanced Beginners<br>
 > can start to break away from the fixed rule set a little bit.They can try tasks on their own, but they still have difficulty troubleshooting.
 Although they can start formulating some overall principles ,there is no "big picture". They have no holistic understanding and really don't want it yet.
 
3.Competent<br>
 > practitioners can now develop conceptual model of the problem domain and work with those models effectively. They can troubledshoot problems ont heir own and
 begin to figure out how to solve novel problems--ones they haven't faced before. Their work is based more on deliberate planning and past experience. Without more
 experience, they will still have trouble trying to determine which details to focus on when problem soving.There isn't yet enough ablitiy for reflection and
 selfcorrection.
 
 4.Proficient<br>
 > They will seek out and want to understand the larger conceptual framework around this skill,they will be very frustrated by oversimplified information.
 They make a major breakthrough on the Dreyfus model: they can correct previous poor task preformance. They can reflect on how they've done and revise their approach to
 perform better the next time.
 
 5.Expert<br>
  >They are the ones who continually look for better of experience that they can tap into and apply in just the right context.
  Experts work from intuition, not from reason.
